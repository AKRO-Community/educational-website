# Gas Fees

## What are Gas fees? 

Why do they exist - based on transaction demand, incentivize miners to process your transaction, inherent in all Ethereum transactions.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

## Tips to save on gas fees:

* Monitor Etherscan charts for lulls in the transaction mempool
* Visit [ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info/) to stay up to date on the current gas price
* Decrease the frequency with which you claim your yield rewards
